### AI BASED TOOL FOR PRILIMINARY DIAGNOSIS OF DERMATOLOGICAL MENIFISTATION 

#### DISCRIPTION 
- The Global Burden of Disease project has shown that skin diseases continue to be the 4th leading cause of nonfatal disease burden worldwide. These conditions are often the presenting face of more severe systemic illnesses, including HIV and neglected tropical diseases (NTD). such as elephantiasis and other lymphedema- causing diseases. Additionally, skin disorders pose a significant threat to patients' well-being, mental health, ability to function, and social participation. However, it is very difficult to provide better dermatological care to under-served or resource- poor regions in a cost-effective manner owing to unavailability of efficient diagnostic tools, lack of connectivity, and poor laboratory infrastructure etc. Moreover, there is also a scarcity of physicians with dermatological training. Even, preliminary screening of a dermatological manifestation seems to be an arduous task. Thus, developing an Artificial intelligence-based tool (through Image processing technique) for preliminary diagnosis of numerous dermatological conditions will prove to be a boon in the health care system.


#### Finding from Global Burdon of disease project
- Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Project – Skin Diseases
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project, coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), is a large international effort to quantify the impact of diseases, injuries, and risk factors across countries, time, and populations.
**Skin Disease Findings from GBD**
- High Prevalence: Skin and subcutaneous diseases are among the most common human illnesses worldwide, affecting all age groups.
Major Contribution to Disability: While skin diseases rarely cause death, they are a leading cause of non-fatal disease burden, measured in Years Lived with Disability (YLDs).
- Key Conditions: The most significant skin-related contributors to global disability include:
Dermatitis (atopic, contact, seborrheic)
Psoriasis
Acne vulgaris
Fungal skin diseases
Scabies
Alopecia areata
Urticaria
Viral skin diseases (warts, herpes)
- Disability Burden: Collectively, skin conditions account for about 1.8–2% of the total global disease burden (measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years, DALYs).
- Regional Variations: Prevalence and severity differ by region due to environment, hygiene, socioeconomic status, and healthcare access.
Psychosocial Impact: Beyond physical symptoms, skin diseases often lead to stigma, depression, and reduced quality of life.

#### MOST COMMON SKIN DISEASES
- Acne vulgaris – pimples, blackheads, whiteheads (especially in teens and young adults).
- Atopic dermatitis (Eczema) – chronic itchy inflammation, often starting in childhood.
- Psoriasis – autoimmune scaling patches, lifelong condition.
- Fungal infections – ringworm, athlete’s foot, yeast infections.
- Scabies – mite infestation, very itchy and contagious.
- Urticaria (Hives) – sudden red, itchy welts due to allergies.
- Alopecia areata – autoimmune hair loss in patches.
- Warts (HPV infection) – common viral skin growths.
- Impetigo & cellulitis – bacterial infections, more common in children.
- Skin cancers – melanoma and non-melanoma (linked with sun exposure).
