### AI BASED TOOL FOR PRILIMINARY DIAGNOSIS OF DERMATOLOGICAL MENIFISTATION 

#### DISCRIPTION 
- The Global Burden of Disease project has shown that skin diseases continue to be the 4th leading cause of nonfatal disease burden worldwide. These conditions are often the presenting face of more severe systemic illnesses, including HIV and neglected tropical diseases (NTD). such as elephantiasis and other lymphedema- causing diseases. Additionally, skin disorders pose a significant threat to patients' well-being, mental health, ability to function, and social participation. However, it is very difficult to provide better dermatological care to under-served or resource- poor regions in a cost-effective manner owing to unavailability of efficient diagnostic tools, lack of connectivity, and poor laboratory infrastructure etc. Moreover, there is also a scarcity of physicians with dermatological training. Even, preliminary screening of a dermatological manifestation seems to be an arduous task. Thus, developing an Artificial intelligence-based tool (through Image processing technique) for preliminary diagnosis of numerous dermatological conditions will prove to be a boon in the health care system.
